		"description":"At the moment eddy works for single- or multi-shell diffusion data, i.e. it doesn't work for DSI data. In order to ensure that the data is shelled eddy checks it, and only proceeds if it is happy that it is indeed shelled. The checking is performed through a set of heuristics such as i) how many shells are there? ii) what are the absolute numbers of directions for each shell? iii) what are the relative numbers of directions for each shell? etc. It will for example be suspicious of too many shells, too few directions for one of the shells etc. It has emerged that some popular schemes get caught in this test. Some groups will for example acquire a mini shell with low b-value and few directions and that has failed to pass the check, even though it turns out eddy works perfectly well on the data. For that reason we have introduced the --data_is_shelled flag. If set, it will bypass any checking and eddy will proceed as if data was shelled. Please be aware that if you have to use this flag you may be in untested territory and that it is a good idea to check your data extra carefully after having run eddy on it.",

If, on visual inspection, one finds residual movement or EC-induced distortions it is possible that eddy has not fully converged. In that case we primarily recommend that one uses --fwhm=10,0,0,0,0, as described above, to speed up convergence. Only if that fails do we recommend increasing the number of iterations.",

If the defaults are used for all those parameters an outlier is defined as a slice whose average intensity is at least four standard deviations lower than the expected intensity, where the expectation is given by the Gaussian Process prediction. The default is to not do outlier replacement since we don't want to risk people using it unawares. However, our experience and tests indicate that it is always a good idea to use --repol.",

If --mporder is set to N-1, where N is the number of excitations in a volume, the location of each slice/MB-group is individually estimated. We don't recommend going that high and in our tests we have used values of N/4 -- N/2. The underlying temporal model of movement is a DCT basis-set of order N. Slice-to-vol motion correction is computationally very expensive so it is only implemented for the CUDA version.",

This information is necessary for eddy to know how a temporally continuous movement translates into location of individual slices/MB-groups. Let us say a given acquisition has N slices and that m is the MB-factor (also known as Simultaneous Multi-Slice (SMS)). Then the file pointed to be --slspec will have N/m rows and m columns. Let us for example assume that we have a data-set which has been acquired with an MB-factor of 3, 15 slices and interleaved slice order. The file would then be [0 5 10;2 7 12;4 9 14;1 6 11;3 8 13] where the first row [0 5 10] specifies that the first, sixth and 11th slice are acquired first and together, followed by the third, eighth and 13th slice etc. For single-band data and for multi-band data with an odd number of excitations/MB-groups it is trivial to work out the --slspec file using the logic of the example. For an even number of excitations/MB-groups it is considerably more difficult and we recommend using a DICOM->niftii converter that writes the exact slice timings into a .JSON file. This can then be used to create the --slspec file.",
