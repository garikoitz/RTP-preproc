# RTP-preproc
Reproducible Tract Profiles - preprocessing.

This gear takes diffusion images, bvec and bval files, and optionally a T1 and preprocess them. 
The output of this gear is prepared to go to RTP-pipeline.

This gear is an adaptation from mrTrix's (https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3) recommended preprocessing procedure implemented in Brainlife (https://brainlife.io/app/5a813e52dc4031003b8b36f9)
